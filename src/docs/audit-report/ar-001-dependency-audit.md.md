## Dependency Change Decision

We decided to migrate from the `neverthrow` library to [`ts-belt`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mobily/ts-belt) to enable more secure and expressive functional programming patterns using `Option` and `Result` types.

### Security and Stability Evaluation

- **Popularity and Community:**

  - Over 128,000 weekly downloads on npm
  - Consistent upward trend in adoption
  - 33 secure dependents
  - Active and well-maintained GitHub repository

- **Security Review:**

  - Verified on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mobily/ts-belt)
  - Checked via [Debricked](https://debricked.com/select/package/npm-@mobily/ts-belt) for vulnerabilities in recent versions

After installing the library, we performed a full audit which confirmed that there are no security issues associated with the package.
