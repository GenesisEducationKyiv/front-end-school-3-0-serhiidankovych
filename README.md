## ⚡ Performance & Optimizations

Performance and accessibility were key priorities. The following optimizations were implemented to improve user experience:

-   **Optimized Image Loading**: Implemented strategies to reduce image-related delays and prevent layout shifts (CLS).
-   **Reduced Render-Blocking Resources**: Minimized render-blocking delays to significantly improve the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) metric.
-   **Enhanced Accessibility**: Added meaningful, accessible names to all interactive elements like buttons and links.
-   **Back-Forward Cache (bfcache)**: Ensured WebSocket connections are properly closed on navigation to allow the browser to use `bfcache` for instant back/forward navigations.

  <br>
  
## 📦 Build
The app uses a **hybrid rendering strategy** to optimize performance and flexibility. The homepage and error page are **statically generated** for fast load times. The `/tracks` route is **server-side rendered** to handle dynamic logic or authentication. Individual track pages (`/tracks/[id]`) are **statically generated at build time**, providing excellent performance and SEO benefits.
